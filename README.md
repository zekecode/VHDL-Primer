# VHDL-Primer
We will be using VHDL for mos projects.  
*As I go through this exercise that I will build up other sections such as arithmatic, 2C aka 2's Complimnet
*Structured SData Processing Design and Logic
* Boolean Algebra and LUTs
* How FF store states
* A blinking LED project
* Test you VHDL Code
* FPGA Modules
* A blinking LED project - Par II
* Synthesis, Place and Route, CDC (Clock Domain Crossings)
* State Machines
* A Games on FPGAs - Part I
* FPGA Primatives straight out of VIVADO and ISE
* Arithmatic and Computation on an FPGA - Algorithms
* I/O on FPGAs
* Dev Boards

*****************************************************************************************************
The build up will be as such as this lays the ground for all other FPGA builds:
1.  VHDL Primer
2.  RTL Design
3.  Dersign of Digital Sytems
4.  Connecting to a keyboard
5.  VGA with FPGAs
6.  Interface of Text in Video
7.  Digital Audio with DSP on an FPGA
8.  Peripherals on FPGAs
9.  VHDL In-Depth
